# Convolutional Anomaly Detection Autoencoder
This is an re-implementation of "Reverse Reconstruction of Anomaly Input Using Autoencoders" from Akihiro Suzuki et al. and the improvement proposed by Al Aama Obada. For further information, please look at the report `report.pdf` or ask me.

## Requirements:
  1. Python 3.6.8
  2. Tensorflow 1.12.0
  3. Matplotlib 3.0.2
  4. Numpy 1.15.4 

## Run
To train the model and test after training: `python main.py`.
